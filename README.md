## BUILD AND INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

This has been tested to work on Ubuntu.

To build and install you will need <strong>binutils</strong> and <strong>build-essential</strong>.
If you want to use your own compiler set it in the Makefile.

Run these commands in your shell:

<code>make BUILD_TYPE=release</code>
<code>sudo make install BUILD_TYPE=release</code>

By default the build type is debug so we need to set it to release.
